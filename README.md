This repository contains GNU Radio and Python files to implement a setup based on two software defined radios (SDRs)
for characterization of frequency-selective surfaces. Here, one SDR acts as a signal generator and the other acts as
a spectrum analyzer. The GNU Radio files define this behavior. The Python files are used as auxiliary parts of the 
GNU Radio files and also for post-processing.
